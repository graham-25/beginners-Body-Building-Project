# beginners-Body-Building-Project
My first project for my portfolio HTML/CSS
Project proposal
Beginners Body Building Club website.
Purpose:
To give the user an instructive information about how to start body building, warm up, stretching, preforming individual exercises & cooldown.  To give a basic exercise routine that someone could follow and see some benefits.  Have a sign-up form for joining the Beginners Club and get supporting e-mail info.  Have a contact information section and links to social media, provide listings of recommended gyms in the local area.  

Strategy:  
We want to create a website where a user can go and find out how to begin a body building mission, find out how to correctly use the equipment and properly build their fitness to achieve their personal goals.
Scope:   
1.	Provide a section explaining what the goal of the site/business is to the user.
2.	Provide detailed pictures relating to exercise with links to the specific exercises.
3.	Provide a form so that the user can join the club and record their e-mail details.
4.	Provide a suggested place to work out for the user.
5.	Provide a dumbbell exercise program to the user. With additional images for future improvement and to build the site up.
6.	Provide social media links for the user to join to get support from other club members.
7.	Provide an additional YouTube video to support my workout method.

Structure:  
We are going to structure our page, first with a header with the name of the business/program.  We want an image as a background that doesn’t move when the user scrolls down the page, so the page is always colourful.  We then going to have an about section explaining to the user what the site is about and what they can expect.  
We then will put in the images where the user can select to go to the specific exercise pages to get the information they want on the specific exercise equipment.  Some first time users may not know or have seen any exercising equipment before, so we want to put the name of the exercise equipment with the picture. We want to make it as eye catching as possible so we want to put in some hover effect that will stand out for our site. 
We then want a form section where the user can input their personal details, so they can receive club membership and promotion offers.  This will also give the business a customer base where we can send targeted promotions and information to specific individuals, we also want to create a profile of our customers so information gathering of exercise habits, body types of our users, their goals and preferred exercise, where they would prefer to exercise, when their preferred time to workout is. We also have to factor in that the form needs to be large enough so visually impaired people can use it as well.
We then going to have a contact section where users can get in touch and ask questions, this section is also going to have a suggested place to work out based on my own experience.  
Finally, we want a footer section with copy right information and social media links to extra support and information on the social media platforms, these links will open in new tabs and the user will be informed that these links do that..

Second page: Dum Bell page:
We are going to have a header section which will mirror the main home page header for consistency.  We will then have a warm-up unordered list where the user can follow to prepare for the main exercise aspect, nothing too strenuously just to warm up the body.
We will include some image to emphasise what piece of equipment we are using, make the page colourful and inviting.
Next we are going to have an ordered list element going through the individual steps in lifting the specific weights correctly, this is to minimum potential injury.  We want to create a concrete foundation in making the user understand the impotency of the correct procedure in lifting.
We then going to have a You Tube video supporting the information that I have listed in my product.
Finally we will put our footer as in the main page for consistency and social media resources so our users can get extra support on these platforms.
